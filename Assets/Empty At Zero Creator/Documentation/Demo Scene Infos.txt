Demo Scene Infos : 
	General Infos :
	- I placed on purpose all the parent GameObjects in a local position, local rotation different from (0,0,0) 
	and a local scale different from (1,1,1) so you can see what are their child local position, 
	local rotation and local scale, when their parent transform is not reseted to default values.

	- The GameObject A1 (global) position, (global) rotation are set to (0,0,0) and (global) scale to (1,1,1), 
	but its local position, local rotation and local scale aren't because its parent transform values are not reseted.

	- There are still some differences (for illustration purpose) between what you can see 
	in the demo scene and the tool direct usage : 
		- The gameObjects you will create with this tool will be named "GameObject" by default.
		- The gameObjects you will create with this tool won't have an icon by default.

	Demo Scene before Unity 4.6 :
	- This scene illustrates the results of the creation of Empty GameObjects before Unity 4.6

	Demo Scene Unity 4.6 and after :
	- This scene doesn't work in a version of Unity anterior of 4.6
	- This scene illustrates the results of the creation of Empty GameObjects on Unity 4.6 and after
