How to use : 

- General infos :
	When a GameObject is created as a child of another GameObject with a RectTransform component on it, 
	it will add a RectTransform component to the created GameObject.

- Create Empty At Zero :
	GameObject -> Create Empty At Zero (or use [Alt + N] shortcut with the keyboard).
	or inside the Hierarchy Context Menu (since Unity 4.6) : Create Empty At Zero 
	(Right click inside the Hierarchy window)

	It creates a new Empty GameObject called "GameObject" on the Scene and selects it.
	Its localPosition at creation is at Vector3.Zero (0,0,0).

	If you have already a GameObject selected on the Scene :

		if you have created the GameObject from the Hierarchy Context Menu :
			the new Empty GameObject is created as child of the already selected GameObject,

		else if you have created the GameObject from the GameObject window or from the keyboard shortcut :
			the new Empty GameObject is created at Scene root.

	Else if you have no GameObject already selected 
	(whatever if you used the Hierarchy Context Menu, the GameObject window or the keyboard shortcut) :
		the new Empty GameObject is created at Scene root.
	

- Create Empty Child At Global Zero :
	GameObject -> Create Empty Child At Global Zero 
	(or use [Ctrl + Alt + N] shortcut on Windows / [Cmd + Alt + N] shortcut on macOS with the keyboard).

	It creates a new Empty GameObject called "GameObject" on the Scene and selects it.
	Its (global) position at creation is at Vector3.Zero (0,0,0).

	If you have already a GameObject selected on the Scene :
		the new Empty GameObject is created as child of the already selected GameObject.
	Else : 
		the new Empty GameObject is created at Scene root.

- Create Empty Child At Local Zero :
	GameObject -> Create Empty Child At Local Zero (or use [Ctrl + Alt + Shift + N] shortcut on Windows / [Cmd + Alt + Shift + N] shortcut on macOS with the keyboard).

	It creates a new Empty GameObject called "GameObject" on the Scene and selects it.
	Its localPosition at creation is at Vector3.Zero (0,0,0).

	If you have already a GameObject selected on the Scene :
		the new Empty GameObject is created as child of the already selected GameObject.
	Else : 
		the new Empty GameObject is created at Scene root.
