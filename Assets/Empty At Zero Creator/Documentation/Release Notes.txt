v1.1.1 : Bug solved (A Null Reference Exception when you created a gameobject with no parent).

v1.1.0 : From Unity 4.6 when the GameObject is created as a child of another GameObject with a RectTransform component on it, 
	it will add a RectTransform component to the created GameObject.

v1.0.2 : Build errors fixed, minor changes in scripts and documentation.

v1.0.1 : Keyboard shortcuts changed to prevent possible interferences with typing.
	Now, the keyboard shortcut for "Create Empty At Zero" is [Alt + N], instead of [Shift + N].
	and "Create Empty Child At Local Zero" is [Ctrl + Alt + Shift + N] on Windows / [Cmd + Alt + N] on macOS, instead of [Alt + N].

v1.0.0 : First released version.
